Load test project using Gatling


## What is Gatling?

---

Gatling is a highly capable load testing tool. It is designed for ease of use, maintainability and high performance.

Out of the box, Gatling comes with excellent support of the HTTP protocol that makes it a tool of choice for load 
testing any HTTP server. As the core engine is actually protocol agnostic, it is perfectly possible to implement support for other protocols. For example, Gatling currently also ships JMS support.


## Why choose Gatling?

---

I was the Software Quality Engineer at Electronic Arts Korea who is in charge of the test of our game server reliability
and availability. Gatling has the Enterprise version called Gatling Frontline but an open source version is powerful to 
test as well.
